This directory contains code to  create   AES  encrypted  streams and is
contributed to SWI-Prolog by SecuritEase under  the LGPL. It is included
in the source, but it is currently not a proper package.

TODO:

	* Add eas.pl that can be installed into the library
	* Create SWI-Prolog package autoconfig/makefile framework
	* Convert documentation into LaTeX (or PlDoc).
	* Add simple test framework

If anyone wishes to pick this up, please contact me.
